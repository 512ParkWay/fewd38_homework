      <h1>Laura Stupi</h1>

      <h2>Arctic and Desert Explorer Geoscientist Mom</h2>

      <p>I'm Laura Stupi. I live in South San Francisco but spend as much time as I can in the Alaskan Arctic and the canyons of southeast Utah. I studied geology and mineral physics and worked in my chosen field for 14 years. I have a 4 year old daughter named Xochitl, her and I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu together.</p>
