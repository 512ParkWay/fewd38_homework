          <p class="article">I'm Laura Stupi. I live in South San Francisco but spend as much time as I can in the Alaskan Arctic and the canyons of southeast Utah. I studied geology and mineral physics and worked in my chosen field for 14 years. I have a 4 year old daughter named Xochitl, her and I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, sometimes together.</p>
